# Local Ecom

A minimal local e-commerce app that stores products in browser localStorage and provides an Admin Dashboard for CRUD operations.

Quick start

1. cd local-ecom
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Admin credentials: `admin@example.com` / `admin123`

Notes

- Uses Tailwind CDN for styles (fast to iterate).
- Server is optional; localStorage is the primary data layer.
